# Module 5 - Project #1

## Creating an Application for Desktop Display:

- Must be responsive and have a polished UI (must be supportive and user friendly on different screen sizes)
- must use client-side storage to store persistent data
- must be interactive (i.e. accept and respond to user input)
- must meet good quality coding standards (indentation, scoping, defining variables, naming, etc.)
- Use a CSS framework (use third party frameworks apart form using your own so you know how to integrate different forms- will make things easier)
- must include at least one modal (instead of alert, prompt, or confirm methods)
- Have a quality README _created in an HTML format or .md format_ or can use gitHub Copilot to create a baseline ReadMe file\* (defining details, what does the product do, what has been used in the application, why the project is being created, what tools + technologies have been created, etc.)
- Must be deployed to GitHub Pages

## User Story

```md
AS a shopper,
I WANT to use a to-do list for my grocery shopping,
SO THAT I can utilize my time more efficiently.
```

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 25%

```md
GIVEN a grocery shopping list
WHEN I load the webpage,
THEN I am shown the landing page which utilizes a CSS framework

WHEN I submit the form,
THEN the item appears in the container within the page as a list item, and is stored in localStorage.

WHEN I click on the edit/remove button
THEN the list item is editable or can be deleted

WHEN I submit the form without any information,
THEN an error modal appears on the screen prompting me to enter data in the form (Look into the CSS framework's documentation for more information!)

WHEN a user minimizes or expands the screen,
THEN the webpage will be responsive and adjust to screen size while maintaining a clean UI
```
